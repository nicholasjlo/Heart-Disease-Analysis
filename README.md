# Heart-Disease-Analysis

## Overview

Heart Disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and around the world. In the United States, it accounts for approximately 1 in 4 deaths. The term heart disease can be confusing because it can be used to describe various medical conditions that affect the function and structure of the heart.This project uses data analysis on external data points to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. Some features used in our model include maximum heart rate, cholesterol, and age. This type of predictive modeling can help medical professionals identify at-risk patients earlier and
potentially save lives.

In this project, we aim to determine which factors best predict heart disease, create a model based on those features and assess the predictive capabilities of that model. In our dataset are 303 observations and 14 variables. Our dependent variable is Target which has two values: 0 meaning no heart disease, and 1 meaning heart disease.
